    "Monorepo vs Multi-repo vs Git submodule vs Git Subtree\n\nMonorepo vs Multi-repo vs Git submodule vs Git Subtree: A Complete Guide for Developers\nSubodh Shetty\nSubodh Shetty\n\nFollow\n5 min read\n\u00b7\n2 days ago\n44\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nMonoRepo vs MultiRepo vs Git Submodule vs Git Subtree\nAs projects grow, one question quietly becomes a big one:\n\n\u201cWhere should all this code live?\u201d\n\nSome teams prefer to keep everything in one place. Others prefer to split things into smaller, separate repositories. A few connect repositories using Git submodules or subtrees. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk through each strategy in plain English. You\u2019ll learn what each one does, when it helps, and what you trade off when you choose it. 1. Monorepo\nA monorepo means one big repository for all your projects. That includes backend, frontend, libraries, and sometimes even deployment scripts. Example\nImagine you are building an e-commerce system. Your structure might look like this:",
    "Your structure might look like this: Example\nImagine you are building an e-commerce system. Your structure might look like this:\n\n\nFolder structure\nDevelopers from multiple teams work inside this same repository.",
    "Your structure might look like this:\n\n\nFolder structure\nDevelopers from multiple teams work inside this same repository. Folder structure\nDevelopers from multiple teams work inside this same repository. Why teams use monorepos\nMonorepos make it easier to change related code together. Suppose your frontend and backend share a common API. You can update both sides in one pull request, and both will stay in sync. You also have one build pipeline, one testing setup, and one linting configuration. That makes consistency simple. What to keep in mind\nWhen a monorepo grows, builds can become slow if you do not optimize them. You also need a clear sense of code ownership. Without that, people can make changes in places they shouldn\u2019t. CODEOWNERS files help define who reviews which parts of the repository. When it fits\nMonorepos work best for small to medium teams where services are closely connected. They make shared tooling and cross-team collaboration easier. 2. Multi-repo (or Polyrepo)\nA multi-repo setup means each project has its own repository. It is the most common approach in the industry.",
    "It is the most common approach in the industry. Example\nYour company might have following Git repositories:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nEach repository has its own CI/CD setup, its own issue tracker, and its own release process.",
    "Example\nYour company might have following Git repositories:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nEach repository has its own CI/CD setup, its own issue tracker, and its own release process. Each repository has its own CI/CD setup, its own issue tracker, and its own release process. Why teams use multi-repos\nMulti-repos give teams freedom. Each team controls its own repo, deployment, and tools. The frontend team can use React while the backend uses Spring Boot or Node.js. Access control also becomes easier. Only members who work on a service need access to its repository. Real-world example\nThink of a company that has separate payments, catalog, and shipping teams. Each one builds its own service. They deploy independently and have different release schedules. That independence makes multi-repo a good fit. What to keep in mind\nWhen multiple repos depend on a shared library, keeping them consistent can be hard. If you fix a bug in that library, you need to update each repo using it. Cross-repo changes take longer and require coordination. When it fits\nMulti-repos are ideal for larger teams where services are mostly independent and ownership boundaries are clear.",
    "When it fits\nMulti-repos are ideal for larger teams where services are mostly independent and ownership boundaries are clear. 3. Git Submodules\nA Git submodule adds a reference to another repository at a specific commit. It does not copy the repository\u2019s content into your main repo\u2019s history. Instead, it just stores a pointer to the commit in the external repo. Example\nYou have:\n\nmain-app repository\nshared-logging repository\nYou add it like this:\n\ngit submodule add https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git libs/shared-logging\nYour main repository now contains the shared-logging code inside the libs/shared-logging folder. Updating a submodule\nIf the submodule has new commits, you need to pull them manually:\n\ncd libs/shared-logging\ngit checkout main\ngit pull origin main\ncd ../..\ngit add libs/shared-logging\ngit commit -m \"Update submodule to latest commit\"\nThat updates your main repo to point to the newer commit of the submodule. Cloning your main repo\nWhen someone clones your main repo, they have to run the following to download that external code. :",
    ": Cloning your main repo\nWhen someone clones your main repo, they have to run the following to download that external code. :\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nOptional tracking\nIf you want your submodule to follow a specific branch:\n\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git libs/shared-logging\nThen fetch updates using:",
    ":\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nOptional tracking\nIf you want your submodule to follow a specific branch:\n\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git libs/shared-logging\nThen fetch updates using: git submodule add -b main https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git libs/shared-logging\nThen fetch updates using:\n\ngit submodule update --remote\nWhy it exists\nSubmodules are designed for situations where you want to reuse code that lives in another repository. It\u2019s like having a dependency that you control. You decide when to upgrade to the next version by updating the pointer. What to keep in mind\nSubmodules need discipline. Submodules don\u2019t auto-update. You must manually pull updates. You have to remember to initialize them and update them when cloning. CI/CD pipelines must also handle them properly. 4. Git Subtree\nWhile submodules keep a pointer to another repository, a Git subtree actually copies the other repository\u2019s content into your own. It is like pulling another repository\u2019s code into a subfolder. Example\nYou can add a subtree like this:",
    "Example\nYou can add a subtree like this: Example\nYou can add a subtree like this:\n\ngit subtree add --prefix=libs/shared-logging https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git main --squash\nThis command copies all code from the shared-logging repository into the folder libs/shared-logging and adds it as part of your project. When the shared library gets updates, you can pull those updates later:\n\ngit subtree pull --prefix=libs/shared-logging https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git main --squash\nIf you make local changes and want to send them back upstream:",
    "When the shared library gets updates, you can pull those updates later:\n\ngit subtree pull --prefix=libs/shared-logging https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git main --squash\nIf you make local changes and want to send them back upstream: git subtree push --prefix=libs/shared-logging https://github.com/org/shared-logging.git main\nHow it works\nA subtree merges the other repository\u2019s history into yours. The files become a permanent part of your repository. Your project can now build without needing the external repository. Advantages\nNo extra setup for developers. Works with normal git clone. No special CI handling required. All code is available locally. What to keep in mind\nYour repository size grows because it includes the subtree\u2019s history. Managing many subtrees can become complex. You need to remember which folder maps to which external repository. When to use\nSubtrees are a good fit when you want to vendor another repository\u2019s code. That means you want to copy it inside your repo and update it occasionally. It\u2019s common for internal forks or open-source libraries that you customize. In Conclusion,",
    "In Conclusion, That means you want to copy it inside your repo and update it occasionally. It\u2019s common for internal forks or open-source libraries that you customize. In Conclusion,\nRepository structure influences how teams work, not just how code is stored. It affects how you test, deploy, and collaborate.",
    "It affects how you test, deploy, and collaborate. Before deciding, ask:\n\nHow independent are your services? How often do they change together? How do you want to manage shared code? A monorepo offers simplicity and consistency. A multi-repo offers independence and flexibility. A submodule links projects that evolve separately. A subtree embeds projects that need to live together. Each one solves a different kind of problem. Once you understand their behavior, choosing the right one becomes straightforward."
