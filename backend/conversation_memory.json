Escitalopram, due to its lack of the R enantiomer, may be more effective than citalopram for depression and has the highest specificity for serotonin transporter (SERT) among SSRIs. It is noted that both drugs, especially citalopram, are more frequently associated with QT prolongation compared to other SSRIs, with a dose-dependent relationship.
