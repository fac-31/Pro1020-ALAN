RAG stands for Red, Amber, Green and is commonly used in project management to indicate the status of tasks or projects. \n\nTo give you a brief overview, in RAG status:\n- Red indicates tasks that are behind schedule or facing significant issues.\n- Amber signifies tasks that are at risk but can still be recovered.\n- Green shows tasks that are on track and progressing well.\n\nIf you'd like to delve deeper into RAG and its application in project management, I can suggest some resources or provide more information. Just let me know how I can assist you further!\n\nBest regards,\nAlan",
